# Poem Bot
You will need to install a 43 MB file from [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gw2uLmbpG8nwGsMMqF_uXm6YSlfD7B_P?usp=sharing) drive link.

Put this is the same directory as the program.

The final output file will be named "final_trim.mp3"

## Requirements

You will need:
- Python 3
- pydub
- gtts
- ffmpeg
In the code you may need to change the directory for ffmpeg if it is stored somewhere else

### This is the code for Windows machines, I will make one for Mac and Linux later down the line.

The code for creating the poem is in a function and running the file will output the test poem. You can import it as a library and use it however you want.
